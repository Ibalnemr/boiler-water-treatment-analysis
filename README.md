# Data Analysis for Chemical Water Treatment in High Pressure Boiler

This project analyzes chemical water treatment data for a high pressure boiler in a power plant to ensure efficiency, safety, and protection against corrosion and scaling.

## ⚠️ Note
The data used in this project is simulated and AI-generated for educational and analytical purposes. It does not represent real plant data.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Protect the boiler from corrosion and deposits  
- Improve operational efficiency and reduce fuel consumption  
- Ensure safe operating conditions  
- Compare Hydrazine vs DEHA for dissolved oxygen control  

## 📝 Project Implementation Stages

### 1. Data Collection
- Data collected using AI with fixed limits for variables: pH, Cond, DO, Fe, Phosphate  
- Calculated required chemical injections (Ammonia, Hydrazine or DEHA, Phosphate)  
- Raw data contains errors and inconsistencies (dirty data)

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Removing empty or duplicate cells  
- Correcting negative values  
- Fixing spelling errors  
- Correcting formats (dates, text, units)  
- Detecting and handling outliers

### 3. Tools Used
- Excel: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting  
- Dynamic Dashboard (Excel) for visualization and answering project questions
